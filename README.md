A site for documenting the practices of the technical chair role for the annual virtual conference of the [Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH)](https://ach.org/). The tech chair and co-chair create and sustain the conference's infrastructure, and they serve as key members of the event's organization committee. 

The guide was created using [Eleventy LibDoc](https://eleventy-libdoc.netlify.app/), a template for the [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.
